Web Scrapping Repo

This Web Scrapping repository was made from an open source database, located in the *data* directory. In the *source* directory you can find the configuration file and the main code functions for the analitic development. There is also a Jupyter Notebook with the explanations of the project, the background and tasks. I hope you enjoy it, leave some stars and make some comments if you have any question/critics, etc.
